            Oh hey, didn’t see you there. Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where Legos are life, quad gains are the goal, and PROTEEEEEIIIINNNNNNN is the fuel. If you’re looking for someone with the gym dedication of a Greek god, the vinyl collection of a 70-year-old hipster, and the basketball obsession of a true Kentucky fan, then congrats—you’ve arrived at peak Abby Murdock.<br>
<br>
First things first: Jesus is my Lord and Savior, and Liquid Death is my holy water. When I’m not in the gym obliterating leg day, I’m probably staying as far away from my stinky brother Gavin as humanly possible (seriously, someone get that dude some Febreze). I also dedicate an unreasonable amount of time to collecting vinyl records, screaming at the TV during UK games, and dominating in Roblox tycoons.<br>
<br>
My dogs, The Lunatic and The Floof, run my life. One is a chaotic menace, and the other is basically a cloud with an attitude—but I wouldn’t have it any other way. When I’m not dealing with their shenanigans, you can find me vibing to Mac Miller, Clairo, Noah Kahan, Tyler Childers, and Zach Bryan while pretending I have my life together.<br>
<br>
I am, at my core, an academic weapon. Studying? Easy. Lifting? Even easier. Making a meal that isn’t 90% protein powder? Now that’s a challenge.<br>
<br>
So if you’re here to keep up with my gym progress, music takes, LEGO masterpieces, or general nonsense, buckle up—because this ride is fueled by determination, protein, and an excessive amount of Kentucky pride.<br>
